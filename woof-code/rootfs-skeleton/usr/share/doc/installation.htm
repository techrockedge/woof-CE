        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Puppy can be installed in many different ways. Consequently,
          the installer has many different choices which may be
          confusing to the new Puppy user. This document will attempt to
          clear that confusion such that you, the Puppy User can
          confidently install Puppy Linux to your medium of choice in
          the desired manner. </p>
        <h2 id="tgt">Target Media</h2>
        <p>Puppy can be installed to all common media. USB sticks, USB
          hard drives, Firewire<sup><a href="#2"><small>2</small></a></sup>
          hard drives, CF (Compact Flash), SD card, internal Solid State
          Disk (SSD) and normal old Hard Drives (HDD - either IDE or
          SATA).<br>
          Even CD, DVD and BlueRay™<sup><a href="#1"><small>1</small></a></sup>
          installation (as such) is supported. So, installation can be
          done on any type storage device available for computers. <br>
          CD, DVD installs have some added options when used. In the
          Puppy main Menu there is a program called "Remaster Puppy Live
          CD" where you build your own custom version of Puppy,
          including as many packages and programs as you like.
          Alternatively, if you boot with a CD that was not closed when
          burned, D-RW or DVD-RW<sup><a href="#8"><small>8</small></a></sup>
          you can save your session to the optical media and never worry
          about installing anything! No hard drive needed. </p>
        <h2 id="liv">Live install</h2>
        <p>A live install is usually what is done on a USB flash drive
          (stick) or a CD/DVD.<br>
          All the Puppy files in the Puppy ISO are written to the USB
          stick or the CD/DVD.<br>
          The Puppy ISO has all the needed files to boot this type
          install and run the operating system.</p>
        <p>Good way to try a Puppy version and see how you like it.</p>
        <h2 id="frug">Frugal Install (Recommended to all)</a></h2>
        <p>Frugal is the name used for it, but it is still the complete
          Puppy operating system (OS), only installed in a special way.<br>
          All the Puppy OS is placed inside a Directory(Linux name for
          folder) or folder. Everything Puppy is kept inside this
          directory or folder.<br>
          Frugal name is about how little it uses space for the install.
          Frugal use of the resources on the drive.</p>
        <p>Frugal install can be done on any device that is read/write
          capable. Can be placed on any partition with any type format.</p>
        <p>By design, Puppy Linux runs in your systems Random Access
          Memory (RAM). Normally, a minimum of 512 MB<sup><a href="#9"><small>9</small></a></sup>
          (megabytes) of RAM is recommended to run Puppy but it will
          work with less (See <sup><a href="#9">9</a></sup>). Don't
          worry, any machine built after 2003 is likely to have at least
          enough RAM.<br>
          <br>
          Using this method, Puppy isn't actually installed on your
          system per se´, rather the main files to get Puppy running
          (the kernel or <b>vmlinuz</b>, an initial ram disk or <b>initrd.gz</b>,
          a main puppy system file known as the "Main SFS" usually named
          <b>puppy_<i>puppy-name</i>_<i>puppy-version</i>.sfs</b> or
          similar (for example-puppy_fossapup64_9.5.sfs) and perhaps a
          few other "SFS files" (the files ending in <b>.sfs</b>),
          depending on Puppy version, are copied to your disk for
          installation. This installs your Puppy. Then a <a
            href="#boot">bootloader can be installed</a>.<br>
        </p>
        <p>To be able to boot a frugal install, a boot loader will also
          need to be installed.<br>
          Installer programs that are provided in Puppy, will install
          boot loaders that are designed to make proper boot menu
          entries for frugal install booting.<br>
          Most of these Puppy boot loader installers, will also find
          other than Puppy operating systems installed, and add them to
          the boot loader menu.<br>
          First read the installer help to make sure it can do this.</p>
        <p>If you do a frugal install (folder or directory inside
          another operating system).<br>
          That operating system will already have a boot loader
          installed.<br>
          You can edit that boot loaders boot menu config file and add a
          entry for booting the frugal Puppy install.</p>
        <p>Using this method, Puppy can be installed in almost any
          partition on almost any file system (eg: FAT32, NTFS, ext2,
          ext3, ext4). It can be installed <em>inside</em> an existing
          Installation of Windows, or other Linux such as Ubuntu or
          Fedora. A frugal install also works on all types of media<sup><a
              href="#tgt"><small>3</small></a></sup>. Not only this, but
          current Puppy development and testing is also inclined towards
          Frugal method of Puppy installation. Due to these reasons it
          is advisable to all that they use this method of installation.<br>
          Some features of Puppy Linux only work in frugal installs.<br>
          Due to these reasons it is advisable that you use this method
          of installation.</p>
        <p> For technical information see <a
            href="https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?t=5818"
            target="_blank">How Puppy Works</a>.<br>
        </p>
        <h2 id="full">Full Install</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Full</strong> installation is just like a Windows™
          installation or any other Linux Installation. It requires it's
          own partition and it must be of a Linux type <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system"
            target="_blank">filesystem</a>; most commonly ext2, ext3 or
          ext4 but others are possible. These are mostly used for
          internal HDDs or SSDs but can be used on external USB or
          FireWire HDDs. It is not advisable to install Puppy using this
          method as there is already a <em>better</em> (<a href="#frug">Frugal
          Installation Method</a>) present for installation. </p>
        <h2 id="boot">Booting</h2>
        <p>Booting, in simple terms, is just your computer finding the
          files to execute the Operating System (OS). All Operating
          Systems need some way to boot. Puppy supports various methods
          of booting. Some require the editing of the special boot code
          at the start of the disk (MBR) so that the special Linux files
          can be found (kernel - vmlinuz and initrd.gz).<br>
        </p>
        <p>The boot loader provides this control of the boot process.
          Finding the files needed by the operating system, to start
          running the computer, and proceeding with the boot process to
          a working operating system.</p>
        <p>Puppy can be made to dual-boot with Windows or another Linux
          or multi-boot with several operating systems. There are three
          main programs that Puppy supports out of the box for booting.
          Grub4dos, Grub (legacy), Grub2, and Syslinux.<br>
        </p>
        <p> <br>
          <strong>There are several boot loaders that can be used. Some
            are Puppy programs and are designed for how Puppy works.<br>
            Shown here so you can understand the differences.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Grub4dos</strong>&nbsp; (does not support GPT/UEFI
          systems) supports booting from vfat (FAT32 or FAT16)
          filesystems found in Windows™ 95, 98 and ME and the NTFS
          filesystem introduced in Windows™ NT and also the default
          filesystem of Windows™ 2000, XP, Vista , 7, 8, 8.1 and the
          Windows™ Server family. The program <em>grub4dosconfig</em>
          takes all the hard work out of installing a boot loader and
          automatically detects and configures loading of all your
          installed OS. If you're tentative about modifying the special
          boot sector on your hard drive you can install grub4dos to a
          USB key or a floppy disk.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Grub (legacy)</strong> supports booting from vfat
          (FAT32 or FAT16) filesystems found in Windows™ 95, 98 and ME
          but <strong>not NTFS</strong>. This makes it a good choice to
          install for ancient<sup><a href="#4"><small>4</small></a></sup>
          windows machines or pure Linux machines, with no windows. The
          program <em>Legacy Grub config</em> takes the hard work out
          of installing the grub boot loader. Again, if you're tentative
          about modifying the special boot sector on your hard drive or
          your partition's superblock you can install grub (legacy) to a
          USB key or a floppy disk.<br>
        </p>
        <p><b>Grub2confiig</b> (Puppy program) is a script that installs
          the grub2 boot loader and makes the menu automatically probing
          installed systems, same way as the old Grub4DosConfig,
          enabling multi-boot with Windows, Ubuntu and etc.. It supports
          both legacy MBR system and new GPT/UEFI. Also supports UEFI
          Secure boot, thanks to the Gyrog's MOK manager, that will
          install the Puppy security key.<br>
          <strong></strong></p>
        <p><strong>Grub2 </strong>is usually the boot loader used by
          another operating system that is also installed on your
          computer. That operating system installed and set it up.<br>
          To still use it, you will have to edit it's grub2 boot menu
          config file, adding an entry for the Puppy frugal install.</p>
        <p><strong>Syslinux</strong> supports booting from vfat (FAT32
          or FAT16) filesystems found in Windows™ 95, 98 and ME and the
          many Linux filesystems such as ext2, ext3 and ext4. This is
          used in frugal installs to USB keys in Puppy Linux. USB keys
          can be formatted to vfat or ext(2,3,4). Syslinux can boot hard
          disks and other media but that is beyond the scope of this
          manual.<br>
          <br>
          There is also a new filesystem available in some new Puppy
          versions called the "Flash Friendly File System" (f2fs) which
          is not currently supported by the boot loaders in Puppy but
          can be used all the same with a small vfat or ext2 filesystem
          to boot the kernel with syslinux, grub4dos or grub2config, and
          then find the Puppy Linux files on the f2fs filesystem. If
          your Puppy supports f2fs you can install it to a USB flash
          drive or SD card and use a frugal<sup><a href="#frug"><small>5</small></a></sup>
          or full<sup><a href="#full"><small>6</small></a></sup> type of
          install.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>WakePup2</strong> can also be used to boot Puppy. It
          is a floppy disk image that needs to be transferred to floppy
          disk. It can boot a CD from an ancient computer that can not
          boot from USB or CD in it's <a
            href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bios.htm"
            target="_blank">BIOS</a>. Of course it can also boot the OS
          from the HDD. If WakePup2 is not in your Puppy then you can
          download it from the Puppy Package Manager (PPM).<br>
          <br>
          <strong>NB</strong>: At the time of writing, Puppy's
          grub2config boot loader is only Puppy program that supports <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table"
            target="_blank">GPT</a> partitioning found in new Windows™ 8
          or newer machines and some other operating systems. <br>
        </p>
        <h2 id="progs">Installation Programs</h2>
        <p>You may be confused as to why there are so many options to
          install Puppy. Puppy is Open Source<sup><a href="#7"><small>7</small></a></sup>
          and people love to dive in and write code. It's difficult to
          say what works for everybody so we bundle together a few
          different programs for installation so that if one doesn't
          work the way you want then you can try a different approach.
          All of them may not be included in your Puppy install.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Typical installers you may find in Puppy for doing installs,
          but there may be others you will find in a specific Puppy.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><em>Puppy Universal Installer</em>. (aka <em>PUI</em>)
            (does not support GPT/UEFI systems) This program covers
            nearly every type of installation from full to frugal and
            anything in between. If you want to do a full install this
            is the program you want. It is always included in Puppy
            Linux.</li>
          <li><em>Frugalpup Installer</em>. This one, as the name
            suggests, is an excellent choice if you are after a frugal
            install. Also can install a boot loader for UEFI, legacy
            bios, or both. Provides Puppy security key for UEFI secure
            boot enabled.</li>
          <li><em>BootFlash</em>. An installer specifically targeted at
            USB stick installs. You may want to try this one. Quick and
            easy.</li>
          <li><em>F2fs Usb Installer</em>. A specialised program to help
            you format and install to a f2fs USB flash stick or SD card
            which supports frugal<sup><a href="#frug"><small>5</small></a></sup>
            or full<sup><a href="#full"><small>6</small></a></sup> types
            of installs.</li>
          <li>Pburn a program for burning the Puppy ISO image to a
            CD/DVD.</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
        <p>No matter what your situation, we think that we have got you
          covered. Enjoy installing or not installing, as the case may
          be ☻, <strong>Puppy Linux!</strong></p>
