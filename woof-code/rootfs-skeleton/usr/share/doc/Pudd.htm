		<h1>Pudd: Puppy universal dd</h1>
		<p>
			This is the first version of Pudd, and it is expected many enhancements will follow.
		</p>
		<section>
			<h2>Some notes on terminology</h2>
			<p>
				The words <i>'disk drive'</i> or <i>'hard drive'</i> refer to the entire physical drive, whereas a <i>'partition'</i> is part of the drive that can hold a <i>'filesystem'</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, in the <b>Unix/Linux</b> world, an entire drive may be named like this: <inline-code>/dev/sda</inline-code>, whereas the partitions inside it may be named <inline-code>/dev/sda1</inline-code>, <inline-code>/dev/sda2</inline-code>, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem with this terminology is that in the <b>Windows/DOS</b> world the word <i>'drive'</i> may refer to a partition, not the entire drive. For example, <inline-code>drive C:</inline-code> is really a partition. It is more correct to refer to <inline-code>C:</inline-code> as a <i>'logical drive'</i>, which is also a term used in the <b>Windows/DOS</b> world.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also necessary to distinguish between a partition and a filesystem, which again is blurred in the <b>Windows/DOS</b> world. You can create a partition in a hard drive, then create a filesystem inside it. Examples of filesystems are <inline-code>msdos</inline-code>, <inline-code>vfat</inline-code>, <inline-code>ntfs</inline-code>, <inline-code>ext2</inline-code>, <inline-code>ext3</inline-code>, <inline-code>ext4</inline-code> and <inline-code>reiserfs</inline-code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A point of confusion here is the "DOS <inline-code>format</inline-code>" program. This actually creates a <inline-code>msdos</inline-code> filesystem in a partition. The "DOS <inline-code>fdisk</inline-code>" program can create and delete partitions (note that Linux also has a <inline-code>fdisk</inline-code> program, and it is in Puppy).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Copying drives or partitions</h2>
			<p>
				When I use the word "drive" I am normally referring to the entire drive, and when I use "partition" when I am referring to a partition.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pudd can copy an entire drive or a partition. There are some restrictions here, that I hope to alleviate in future versions of Pudd:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>A drive can only be copied to another identical drive:</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, you can copy a <inline-code>2GB SD card</inline-code> to another <inline-code>2GB SD card</inline-code>, though it is not yet known that if there are any problems copying between different models/makes of SD card, or other types of Flash cards).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<b>A partition can be copied to another partition that is the same size or bigger:</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							There are some details to be worked out here: for now, they must be set to have the same filesystem type. The source filesystem will overwrite whatever is in the destination partition. So far, Pudd can only resize <inline-code>ext2</inline-code>, <inline-code>ext3</inline-code> and <inline-code>ext4</inline-code> filesystems to fill the destination partition.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				Pudd allows you to copy a drive/partition to a file, then you could copy the file to a drive/partition. However, you cannot mix the two. That is, you cannot copy a drive to a file then file to partition, as the file will contain the image of the entire drive, not just a single partition.
