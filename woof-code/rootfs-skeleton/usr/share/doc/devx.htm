        <h1>About Devx</h1>
      </header>
      <p> Available for Puppy Linux is a special file called the "<strong>devx</strong>"
        which is a squash filesystem archive (sfs) that gets loaded in
        the Puppy stack when required. The devx is basically a
        development tool to extend Puppy functionality creating a
        comprehensive development environment for writing and compiling
        programs written in C, C++ and others. It contains the Gnu
        Compiler Collection, header files for all installed programs
        including the Linux Kernel, (nb: this is <em>not</em> the
        kernel sources) Gnu Auto-tools, Python, Perl plus VCS like Git
        and Subversion plus many other useful development tools and
        libraries </p>
      <p> The devx is distro version and architecture dependent; that
        is, for the Puppy you use <em>must</em> use the corresponding
        devx provided by that Puppy distro builder. For example, if the
        Puppy you run is <strong>fossapup64-9.5</strong> you will need
        <strong>devx_fossapup64_9.5.sfs</strong>. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>Obtaining the devx</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p> You can obtain the devx in a number of ways depending on your
        distro. Historically, and still relevant today, the devx can be
        obtained from any of the Puppy Linux Mirrors. There are mirror
        locations at <a
          href="https://puppylinux-woof-ce.github.io/download.html"
          target="blank">the Puppy Linux Downloads page</a>. It will be
        located either at the same place where you downloaded your Puppy
        iso image or in the relevant <b>pet_packages-*</b> directory
        which can be found at <a
          href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/" target="blank">Puppylinux's
          distro.ibiblio site</a>. In <b>Bionicpup64</b> and <b>Fossapup64</b>
        there is an application called "<b>Quickpet</b>" that has an
        entry for the devx. In <b>slacko</b> there is an app called "<b>SFS
          Manager</b>" that contains a link to the devx. For these
        distros you can use these tools if you wish to. </p>
      <p> Note that it is <b>always advised</b> that you put your
        devx.sfs at <b>/mnt/home</b> (the top-most directory of your
        storage device, so that it is outside of your puppy save
        file/folder). </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>Installing the devx</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p> If you use Bionicpup64, Fossapup64 or slacko, the
        aforementioned Quickpet or SFS Manager will install the devx for
        you. For all other puppy based distros, and for these ones as
        well, you can download the devx.sfs manually from <a
          href="https://puppylinux-woof-ce.github.io/download.html"
          target="blank">the Puppy Linux Downloads page</a> for the
        puppy distro you use, open up the directory in which devx.sfs
        was downloaded, and click on the file. A graphical user
        interface (GUI) window will open asking you what you want to do.
        Click "<b>Install SFS</b>". </p>
      <p> <img src="devx.jpg" alt="GUI0"> </p>
      <p> Another GUI will open asking for confirmation that you want to
        install. Click "OK". </p>
      <p> <img src="sfsload0.jpg" alt="GUI1"> </p>
      <p> A further GUI opens asking you if you want to run a program
        that may reside on the devx. Just click "Quit". </p>
      <p> <img src="sfsload1.jpg" alt="GUI2"> </p>
      <p> That's it. You have successfully installed (or actually
        'loaded') the devx and can now start developing for Puppy.
      </p>
      <p>If you ever want to unload the devx.sfs package. Look for the
        program <b>SFS-Load-On-The-Fly</b>. It can load or unload any SFS
        packages you may have.
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>Devx and the Puppy Package Manager</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p> If you have the devx installed and you decide to extend Puppy
        with extra packages from the "<b>Puppy Package Manager</b>"
        (PPM) (or any other package manager specific to the distro that
        you use), then the dependencies of the package that already
        reside in the devx file will not be needed to be installed. So,
        instead of using the package manager to install things like
        compilers, Python, Perl and VCS you should consider downloading
        and installing the devx. Note that if you do install packages,
        which require few dependencies found in the devx, while the devx
        is loaded; and then later on remove the devx, then the installed
        packages may not work as they are expected to, or may not even
        start. So always remember not to remove devx while the programs
        on your computer may need any dependencies from the devx. </p>
